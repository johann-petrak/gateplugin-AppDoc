# TemplatesList

<p>At the moment there is only one template that comes with the plugin:</p>

<h2><code>templates/html_default</code></h2>

<p>This template creates a single simple spartanic HTML output file that contains all the information for applications and processing resources.
The name of the output file is the same as the name of the application/pipeline file documented with ".doc.html" appended.</p>

<p>If another pipeline/controller is used within a pipeline as a processing resource, the details for that nested controller are not shown in the output. To generate the documentation for that controller, you would have to store and generate documentation for it separately.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: please contribute templates or sample HTML/CSS/JS, LaTeX or other textual sample documentation output files so additional good looking and useful documentation styles can be added!</b></p>
