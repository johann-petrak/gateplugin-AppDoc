# Build

<p>Prerequesites:
  * GATE version 6 or later installed in GATE_HOME
  * ant - as GATE comes with ant, you can use GATE_HOME/ant for this
  * Java version 6</p>

<p>All necessary libraries are already contained in the "lib" directory.</p>

<p>To build the plugin and create the JavaDoc just use the command <code>ant</code>. When the compile is successful, this will create the file <code>AppDoc.jar</code> and the JavaDoc documentation files in directory <code>doc/javadoc</code>.</p>
