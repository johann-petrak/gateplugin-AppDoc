Maybe just implement our own mini-markup language and have
simple translation into HTML and LaTeX, could be easier and 
simpler than trying to adapt and adopt existing solutions.
(Where other than TAM/CoW, there is no Java-Based solution
for Markup->Latex anyways).

Just choose a subset of Creole1.0 (http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0)
for now:

See file MARKUP.txt



Now, 2013, CoW (GateWiki) seems to still be the only Java software
that can convert a lightweight markup language into either HTML 
or Latex

Maybe interesting as alternative/additional template engine:

TODO: 
  * Provide a GUI for adding documentation to corpus LRs
  * find a way to document the meaning of annotation types and annotation
    sets. Ideally, this would be some separate declaration similar or 
    identical to annotation schemata. Once loaded, the information 
    would be shown when mousing over the type in the GUI and should 
    be retrievable by some API method.
  * checkout http://code.google.com/p/wikimodel/ - usable for converting
    wiki formats?
  * checkout gatewiki ... hot to converts gatewiki syntax to html/latex?
  * How about reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
  * for MoinMoin => actually, not MoinMoin but Creole! TODO: rename in plugin!

  * consider Markdown markup language; there is a java lib for it here:
    http://code.google.com/p/markdownj/

Markup languages (a list is given as part of http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/
  => SEE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language
  * markdown: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
  * restructuredtext: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html
  * textile: http://redcloth.org/textile

Possible output:
  * HTML
  * Latex
  * PDF
  * OpenOffice/Word (RTF?)
